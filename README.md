## Abstract  
We were tasked to offer insight to the Chief Administrator, Drug Enforcement Administration and the National Forensic Laboratory Information System by creating a mathematical model that predicts the regions where opioid use originated and spread.

With the model, we are asked to identify any possible locations where specific opioid use might have started in each of the five states,find what drug identification threshold levels do these occur and future predictions. 

Additionally, we are asked to modify our model to account for socio-economic trends and come up with a resolution strategy to this crisis.  

## Introduction  

As early as the late 1990’s there was a surge in the use of opioids, a drug intended to be used as a pain reliever, which has resulted in the death of thousands of Americans across the country. The highly addictive drug has left a devastating impact on the population, which has drawn the attention of many federal organizations to track the origins of the drug’s spreading and make predictions about the trend of the crisis. Socioeconomic statuses across different communities have been affected by the crisis, and present unique findings that can help explain the usage of opioids. This report will present the findings of identified patterns and characteristics through a mathematical model and offer insight into the ways that the opioid crisis could be countered.

## Assumptions  
Before building our model, we first came up with some assumptions about the data that we can base our model off of. 

-  When t = 0, or 2010, the highest number of drug reports is where the specific opioid use may have started in the state
-  Every new drug report indicates a new drug addict
-  Addicts are permanently addicts and do not return to a sober state (absorbing state)
-  We grouped together each of the different drugs and assumed that they all have the same effect on an individual
-  Total drug reports are cumulative, meaning that each year’s total synthetic opioid and heroin reports are a new group of addicts
